#  Replication

Welcome to **Replication** – a collection of cloned and replicated real-life websites and applications built with a focus on improving frontend and backend development skills. This repository showcases my ongoing learning journey by attempting to recreate well-known platforms with accuracy, responsiveness, and functionality.

## 📌 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:
- Practice web development through real-world examples.
- Understand the design and functionality of popular websites.
- Enhance skills in frontend, backend, and full-stack development.
- Serve as a personal archive of learning projects.

Each project within this repository reflects my attempt to rebuild the interface and mimic the core features of the original website/application using modern technologies and best practices.
